         <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>Margins© was born in 2025 out of a deep passion for books and the stories they carry. Founded by Gabriel Berioni, a student of Brigham Young University–Idaho, this platform was envisioned as a digital home for readers who find meaning in the margins of their favorite books. Gabriel, a lifelong lover of literature, created Margins© as a way to bridge the gap between modern technology and the timeless act of reading.</p>

    <h1>The Idea Behind Margins</h1>
    <p>As a young reader, Gabriel often found himself writing notes in the margins of his books — reflections, emotions, questions, and quotes that resonated with him. Over time, these margins became more valuable than the printed text itself. Margins© was created to replicate that feeling in the digital world: a place where readers could preserve not only what they read, but how they felt while reading.</p>

    <h1>What We Do</h1>
    <p>Margins© is an interactive, user-friendly platform that allows users to search for books, mark them as read, write and store reviews, and rate their reading experiences. It’s a personal library, a notebook, and a community all in one. With features like book saving, rating systems, and review archiving, Margins helps users track their reading journey and keep their favorite insights in one place.</p>

    <h1>Why It Matters</h1>
    <p>We believe reading is not just about consuming content — it’s about transformation. Every book shapes who we are. In a time when digital distraction often replaces deep reading, Margins© invites users to slow down, reflect, and preserve the emotional weight of their reading experience. It fills a unique need for book lovers who crave more than just a list of titles — they want meaning, memory, and connection.</p>

    <h1>Looking Ahead</h1>
    <p>Margins© is just getting started. In the coming months, we plan to roll out new features including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Social profiles and the ability to follow other readers</li>
        <li>Comment sections for each book review</li>
        <li>Reading goals and yearly summaries</li>
        <li>A mobile-friendly experience and app integration</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our goal is to grow into a global reading network where each user has a voice, a bookshelf, and a story worth sharing.</p>

    <h1>A Personal Note from the Founder</h1>
    <p>“Books have always been a part of my life. They’ve helped me understand the world, escape from it, and come back to it with new eyes. Margins© is a dream come true — not just a project, but a piece of who I am. I hope this space can bring other readers the same joy, discovery, and companionship that books have brought to me.”<br>— Gabriel Berioni</p>

    <h1>Join the Margins© Movement</h1>
    <p>Whether you're a casual reader or a devoted bibliophile, we invite you to be part of our growing community. Save your books, share your thoughts, and discover new stories — not just between the lines, but in the margins.</p>
