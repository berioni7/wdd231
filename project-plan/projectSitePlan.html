    <h1>Name of the website: Margins.</h1>
    <p>It refers to the margins of books, where you can jot down comments or passages. As if it were a personal reflective space for each reader, a human relationship with the book. I think this name can bring the reader closer to the site, having a secure relationship with their books through the Margins “social network”.</p>

    <h2>Margins purpose:</h2>
    <p>Margins is an online social platform dedicated to readers, writers, and lovers of literature. The site provides a space where users can log and share the books they read, write personal reflections and reviews, curate reading lists, and engage in thoughtful discussions about literature with a global community. Just as readers have long used the margins of books to capture their insights, questions, and conversations with the text, Margins brings this spirit of literary dialogue into the digital age — making the act of reading a shared, living experience.</p>

    <h2>Likely questions: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>How might an avid reader who enjoys annotating books and discussing their interpretations with others use Margins to capture and share their thoughts on the books they read?</p></li>
        <li><P>How might a casual reader looking to discover new books and build a personal reading list use Margins to explore recommendations and connect with like-minded readers?</P></li>
    </ul>
